### Solution
Based on the TurboTides integrated design platform, a four-stage impeller and spatial guide vane layout were adopted. Advanced CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) methods were used for the impeller and guide vanes, completing the hydraulic design optimization of the entire pump. This ensures efficient operation at the design point while also accommodating large flow intake capabilities.
