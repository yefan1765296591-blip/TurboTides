The existing ventilation fans suffer from low efficiency and poor performance under their rated power, with serious dust accumulation on the blades. The impeller was redesigned to address these issues. Under the rated power conditions, both flow and pressure were improved, achieving energy-saving effects.

### Solution
In response to the customer’s needs, a tri-flow impeller was adopted to ensure the impeller achieves sufficiently high efficiency, preventing the over-powering issue during operation at the rated point. The blade angle distribution was optimized to reduce the low-speed zone and achieve a more uniform velocity distribution.
