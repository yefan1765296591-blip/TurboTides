### Solution
Based on TurboTides’ multi-stage centrifugal compressor module, rapid distribution of multi-stage compression ratios is conducted. Coupled with an integrated design platform, fast design, simulation, and modeling of multi-stage configurations are performed, facilitating the quick implementation of the project.
