### Solution
In response to user requirements, aerodynamic optimization of individual components was carried out to ensure the efficient design of the flow path components. To broaden the operating range, a casing with a return flow slot design was adopted, and the impact of different sizes and positions of the return flow slots on aerodynamic performance was studied.
