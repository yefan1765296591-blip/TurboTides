### Solution
In response to the customer's needs, an integrated impeller + axial diffuser layout was adopted on the TurboTides platform to ensure the minimum radial dimensions. Additionally, a special structure was applied to the impeller blade inlet to optimize the cavitation performance of the liquid hydrogen pump. Independent splitter blades were used to ensure the pump's efficiency is maximized.
