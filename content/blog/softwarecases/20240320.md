### Solution
In response to customer needs, hydraulic components were independently optimized. A dual volute casing was used to reduce radial loads. The dimensions of the intake chamber, impeller, and volute were optimized based on area distribution laws to minimize losses in hydraulic components, ensuring the best performance match for the entire hydraulic system.
