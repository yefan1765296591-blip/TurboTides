Due to the high temperature and pressure operating conditions, nuclear power shielding pumps require extremely high reliability. The unreasonable design of the flow components has caused significant flow pulsations during operation, leading to vibration risks within the entire system and reducing the system's reliability.

### Solution
To address the flow pulsations caused by the unreasonable design of the flow components in the nuclear power shielding pump, the impeller and guide vane hydraulic dimensions were optimized, ensuring that the flow through the impeller and guide vanes operates in the optimal state, despite the limitations of the casing structure.
