summary = "Large-scale cryogenic helium refrigeration systems are increasingly gaining attention and are widely used in fusion, high-energy physics, and superconductivity. Major national scientific facilities are equipped with large helium cryogenic systems. The helium cryogenic turbine expander is the core component that needs to be tackled. <!--more-->"

Using TurboTides software, the impeller and nozzle of the expander were fully optimized with an isentropic efficiency optimization goal, while meeting aerodynamic, structural, and other constraints. The rotor dynamics were verified through shaft system modeling, and thermal insulation structures were also designed.
