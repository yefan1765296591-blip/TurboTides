      TurboTides may be a newer player in the turbomachinery CAE software market, but its highly integrated system provides high efficiency. It is easy to use, yet has powerful tools for all types of turbomachinery design needs.

      We are impressed by this product and would like to recommend it to benefit the whole turbomachinery community.
