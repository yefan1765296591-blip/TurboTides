                    <p>Both global /machine level optimization and local component level optimization can be performed using TurboTides' built-in optimization functionality. By setting optimization parameters, defining objectives, selecting appropriate solvers, and optionally constraining input and output parameters, users can conduct automated optimization calculations. The software provides a visualization interface during the optimization process to display real-time iterations of the optimization.</p>

                        <li>Provides the fourth-generation OASIS optimization algorithm based on artificial intelligence and machine learning, effectively addressing optimization design problems with high variability, expensive constraints, multiple objectives, and black-box constraints.</li>
                        <li>The optimizer can call solvers for cycle analysis, one-dimensional, two-dimensional passage flow, CFD, and FEA either separately or in combination.</li>
                        <li>Through script writing, users can customize complex optimization processes, such as multidisciplinary optimization involving CFD and FEA to optimize flow fields and impeller structures.</li>
